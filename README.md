# 🐪 Mkocaml

A simple helper I use to generate OCaml projects. I constantly find myself struggling to remember `dune` commands for
various tasks and how to setup opam files. This project is intended to solve that and make setup quicker.

This tool generates:
  * Git repository
  * Git ignore
  * Executable/Library
  * Opam package
  * Copy of the executable to `/usr/local/bin`
  * Makefile with no nonsense commands
    
 |Makefile command|Description|
 |---|---|
 |`make` or `make build` | Builds the project with dune, copies exe to `/usr/local/bin` |
 |`make install` | Installs the dune projects|
 |`make test` | Runs unit tests|
 |`make clean` | Cleans the project with dune|
 |`make doc` | Generates the documentation for the project|
 | `make publish` | Publishes the opam package| 


# Example
Creating a new executable

    > mkocaml -e new
    > make
    > new
    Hello, World!
